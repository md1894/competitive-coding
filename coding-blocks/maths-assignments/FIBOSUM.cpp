The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the following relation:
F(0) = 0
F(1) = 1
F(N) = F(N - 1) + F(N - 2), N >= 2
Your task is very simple. 
Given two non-negative integers N and M, 
you have to calculate the sum (F(N) + F(N + 1) + … + F(M)) mod 1000000007.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer T (the number of test cases). 
Then, T lines follow. Each test case consists of a single line with two non-negative integers N and M.
Constraints

1<=T<=1000 
0<=N<=M<=10^9

Output Format
For each test case you have to output a single line containing the answer for the task.

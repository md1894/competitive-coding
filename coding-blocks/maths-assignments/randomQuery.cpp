/*


You are given an array a consisting of n positive integers. 
You pick two integer numbers l and r from 1 to n, inclusive (numbers are picked randomly, equiprobably and independently). 
If l > r, then you swap values of l and r. 
You have to calculate the expected value of the number of unique elements in segment of the array from index l to index r, inclusive (1-indexed).
Input Format
The first line contains one integer number The first line contains one integer number n . 
The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, … an — elements of the array. (1 ≤ ai ≤ 106)
Constraints

1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6
Output Format

Print one number — the expected number of unique elements in chosen segment.
NOTE: Print your answer upto the precision of 6 decimal places.
